# PO to AutoGRN

### Project Title: Purchase Order Automation and Integration
### Role: Lead Software Tester
Project Description:
The project involved automating the Purchase Order (PO) process, enabling seamless integration between the ERP system and external APIs for auto-generation of Goods Receipt Notes (GRN) and Delivery Orders (DO). Additionally, the project incorporated Backorder Purchase Order (BOP) processing, leading to the automated creation of GRNs from BOP (GRNBOP). The automation aimed to enhance efficiency, reduce manual intervention, and ensure accurate data transfer between systems.

## Key Responsibilities:
* Led the end-to-end testing of the PO automation module, including Auto GRN and Auto DO functionalities.
* Verified data transfer through APIs, ensuring accurate creation and modification of GRNs when PO changes (item addition, deletion, quantity changes, UOM updates) were detected.
* Conducted comprehensive testing for bulk processing scenarios to validate the automated generation of GRNs after PO creation.
* Performed validation for manual GRN creation to ensure seamless API integration without manual triggering.
* Implemented test cases for Backorder Purchase Orders (BOP) leading to Auto GRNBOP creation, validating data flow from milestone to Barcode API.
* Ensured successful data transmission from the ERP system to client APIs, covering scenarios with full and partial quantities.
* Monitored API responses for successful creation of GRNs and DOs, and ensured correct handling of pending quantities.
* Collaborated closely with developers and stakeholders to troubleshoot integration issues and improve data accuracy.
* Documented test results, prepared bug reports, and performed regression testing after fixes.

## Achievements:
* Successfully validated end-to-end automation, minimizing manual errors and improving processing speed.
* Identified critical bugs during integration testing and collaborated with developers to resolve them.
* Received recognition from the management for efficient handling of complex testing scenarios.
